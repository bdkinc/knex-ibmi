[![npm version](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/@bdkinc/knex-ibmi.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/@bdkinc/knex-ibmi)

**Disclaimer: This library is in beta. Please submit an issue for any bugs encounter or any questions you have.**

## Description

This is an external dialect for [knex](https://github.com/tgriesser/knex). This library uses the ODBC driver and is only tested on IBMi. Here are the IBM OSS Docs https://ibmi-oss-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/odbc/README.html

## Supported functionality

- Query building
- Query execution (see [Limitations](#Limitations))
- Transactions

## Limitations

Currently, this dialect has limited functionality compared to the Knex built-in dialects. Below are some of the limitations:

- No streaming support
- Possibly other missing functionality
- Journaling must be handled separately. After a migration is ran journaling can be configured on the newly created tables. I recommend using the schema utility in the i access client solutions software.

## Installing

`npm install @bdkinc/knex-ibmi`

Requires Node v16 or higher.

## Dependencies

`npm install odbc` see [IBM ODBC Docs for dependencies](https://ibmi-oss-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/odbc/README.html) if you run into any issues

`npm install knex`

## Usage

This library can be used as commonjs, esm or typescript.

```javascript
const knex = require("knex");
const { DB2Dialect } = require("@bdkinc/knex-ibmi");

const db = knex({
  client: DB2Dialect,
  connection: {
    host: "localhost",
    database: "knextest",
    port: 50000,
    user: "<user>",
    password: "<password>",
    driver: "IBM i Access ODBC Driver",
    connectionStringParams: {
      ALLOWPROCCALLS: 1,
      CMT: 0,
    },
  },
  pool: {
    min: 2,
    max: 10,
  },
});

const query = db.select("*").from("table").where({ foo: "bar" });

query
  .then((result) => console.log(result))
  .catch((err) => console.error(err))
  .finally(() => process.exit());
```

or as ESM

```javascript
import knex from "knex";
import { DB2Dialect } from "@bdkinc/knex-ibmi";

const db = knex({
  client: DB2Dialect,
  connection: {
    host: "localhost",
    database: "knextest",
    port: 50000,
    user: "<user>",
    password: "<password>",
    driver: "IBM i Access ODBC Driver",
    connectionStringParams: {
      ALLOWPROCCALLS: 1,
      CMT: 0,
    },
  },
  pool: {
    min: 2,
    max: 10,
  },
});

try {
  const data = await db.select("*").from("table").where({ foo: "bar" });
  console.log(data);
} catch (err) {
  throw new Error(err);
} finally {
  process.exit();
}
```

or as Typescript
note: you will probably need to add skipLibCheck: true in your tsconfig compilerOptions if not there already. I plan to clean up the types so this is not an issue. 

```typescript
import { knex } from "knex";
import { DB2Dialect, DB2Config } from "@bdkinc/knex-ibmi";

const config: DB2Config = {
  client: DB2Dialect,
  connection: {
    host: "localhost",
    database: "knextest",
    port: 50000,
    user: "<user>",
    password: "<password>",
    driver: "IBM i Access ODBC Driver",
    connectionStringParams: {
      ALLOWPROCCALLS: 1,
      CMT: 0,
    },
  },
  pool: {
    min: 2,
    max: 10,
  },
};

const db = knex(config);

try {
  const data = await db.select("*").from("table").where({ foo: "bar" });
  console.log(data);
} catch (err) {
  throw new Error(err);
} finally {
  process.exit();
}
```

## Pooling

Tarn Pooling Configuration

```javascript
const db = knex({
  client: DB2Dialect,
  connection: {
    host: "localhost",
    database: "knextest",
    port: 50000,
    user: "<user>",
    password: "<password>",
    driver: "IBM i Access ODBC Driver",
    connectionStringParams: {
      ALLOWPROCCALLS: 1,
      CMT: 0,
    },
  },
  pool: {
    min: 2,
    max: 10,
    acquireConnectionTimeout: 6000,
  },
});
```

## Configuring your driver

If you don't know the name of your installed driver, then look in `odbcinst.ini`. You can find the full path of the file by running `odbcinst -j`.
There you should see an entry like the one below:

```
[IBM i Access ODBC Driver] <== driver name in square brackets
Description=IBM i Access for Linux ODBC Driver
Driver=/opt/ibm/iaccess/lib/libcwbodbc.so
Setup=/opt/ibm/iaccess/lib/libcwbodbcs.so
Driver64=/opt/ibm/iaccess/lib64/libcwbodbc.so
Setup64=/opt/ibm/iaccess/lib64/libcwbodbcs.so
Threading=0
DontDLClose=1
UsageCount=1

[IBM i Access ODBC Driver 64-bit]
Description=IBM i Access for Linux 64-bit ODBC Driver
Driver=/opt/ibm/iaccess/lib64/libcwbodbc.so
Setup=/opt/ibm/iaccess/lib64/libcwbodbcs.so
Threading=0
DontDLClose=1
UsageCount=1
```

If that still doesn't work, then unixodbc is probably looking for the config files in the wrong directory.
A common case is that the configs are in `/etc` but your system expects them to be somewhere else.
In such a case, override the path unixodbc looks in via the `ODBCSYSINI` and `ODBCINI` environment variables.
E.g., `ODBCINI=/etc ODBCSYSINI=/etc`.
